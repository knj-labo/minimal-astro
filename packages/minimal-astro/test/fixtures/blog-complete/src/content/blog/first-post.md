# Getting Started with Minimal Astro

Welcome to **Minimal Astro**! This is our first blog post demonstrating the capabilities of our lightweight Astro implementation.

## What is Minimal Astro?

Minimal Astro is a simplified version of the popular Astro framework, designed to demonstrate key concepts like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Generate HTML at build time for better performance
- **Islands Architecture**: Load JavaScript only when and where needed
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Mix React, Vue, and Svelte components
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management with schema validation

## Key Features

### 1. Fast Builds

Our build system leverages Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.

```javascript
// Example: Build configuration
export default {
  build: {
    outDir: './dist',
    minify: true,
    sourcemap: true
  }
};
```

### 2. Component Islands

Load JavaScript selectively with our Islands Architecture:

```astro
---
// This runs on the server
const data = await fetchData();
---

<div>
  <h1>Server-rendered content</h1>
  <!-- This component hydrates on the client -->
  <Counter client:load initialCount={0} />
</div>
```

### 3. Content Collections

Manage your content with type safety:

```typescript
const posts = await getCollection('blog');
const publishedPosts = posts.filter(post => !post.data.draft);
```

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to generate your static site

## Conclusion

Minimal Astro provides a great foundation for understanding modern web development concepts. Try it out and see how it can improve your development workflow!
