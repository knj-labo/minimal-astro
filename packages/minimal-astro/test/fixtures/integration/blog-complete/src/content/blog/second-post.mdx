# Advanced Patterns in Minimal Astro

This post explores some advanced patterns you can implement with Minimal Astro, including **MDX support** and **component composition**.

## MDX Integration

One of the powerful features of Minimal Astro is native MDX support. This allows you to:

- Import and use components directly in your markdown
- Mix static content with interactive elements
- Create rich, dynamic documentation

### Interactive Example

Here's a live React component embedded in our MDX content:

<Counter 
  initialCount={5} 
  label="MDX Counter" 
  testId="mdx-counter"
/>

As you can see, the counter is fully functional and maintains its state!

## Component Composition

You can compose complex UIs by combining multiple components:

```astro
---
import Layout from '../components/Layout.astro';
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
import BlogCard from '../components/BlogCard.astro';
---

<Layout title="My App">
  <section>
    <Counter client:load />
    <BlogCard {...postData} />
  </section>
</Layout>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Hydration Strategies

Choose the right hydration strategy for your components:

- `client:load` - Hydrate immediately on page load
- `client:idle` - Hydrate when the browser is idle
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when component comes into view
- `client:media` - Hydrate based on media queries

### Code Splitting

Minimal Astro automatically splits your JavaScript bundles for optimal loading:

```astro
<!-- Each component becomes its own bundle -->
<Counter client:load />
<VideoPlayer client:visible />
<ChatWidget client:idle />
```

## Testing Strategies

When building with Minimal Astro, consider these testing approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user journeys
4. **Performance Tests**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and load times

## Best Practices

### 1. Minimize Client-Side JavaScript

Only hydrate components that need interactivity:

```astro
<!-- Good: Static content stays static -->
<article>
  <h1>Static Title</h1>
  <p>Static content...</p>
  <Counter client:visible /> <!-- Only this needs JS -->
</article>
```

### 2. Optimize Assets

Use the built-in asset optimization:

```astro
---
// Automatic optimization for images
const optimizedImage = '/images/hero.jpg';
---

<img src={optimizedImage} alt="Hero image" loading="lazy" />
```

### 3. Content Organization

Structure your content collections logically:

```
src/content/
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/          # Blog posts
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/          # Documentation  
â”œâ”€â”€ authors/       # Author profiles
â””â”€â”€ projects/      # Project showcases
```

## Conclusion

These advanced patterns help you build scalable, performant applications with Minimal Astro. The key is understanding when to use static generation vs. client-side hydration.

<Counter 
  initialCount={100} 
  label="Final Counter" 
  testId="final-counter"
/>

Happy coding! ðŸš€
