# Welcome to Minimal Astro!

This is our first blog post using the **Minimal Astro** framework - a reimplementation of Astro built from the ground up for educational purposes.

## What We've Built

Our minimal implementation includes:

- 🏗️ **Complete AST Parser** - Handles `.astro` file syntax with frontmatter, HTML, and expressions
- 🎨 **HTML Builder** - Generates optimized static HTML with streaming support
- ⚡ **Vite Integration** - Full HMR support with error overlays and caching
- 🏝️ **Islands Architecture** - Selective hydration with multiple strategies
- 🔄 **Multi-framework Support** - React, Vue, and Svelte renderers
- 📝 **Content Collections** - Type-safe content management with file system scanning

## Islands Architecture in Action

The beauty of Islands Architecture is that JavaScript only loads when and where you need it:

```astro
---
import Counter from './Counter.jsx';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile.vue';
---

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My Blog</h1>
    
    <!-- Static content - no JavaScript -->
    <p>This paragraph is just HTML</p>
    
    <!-- Interactive islands -->
    <Counter client:visible />
    <UserProfile client:idle user={user} />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Hydration Strategies

We support all the essential hydration strategies:

- `client:load` - Hydrate immediately on page load
- `client:idle` - Hydrate when browser is idle
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when component enters viewport
- `client:media` - Hydrate based on media queries
- `client:only` - Skip SSR, hydrate only on client

## What's Next?

This implementation demonstrates the core concepts behind modern web frameworks:

1. **Compile-time Optimization** - Transform declarative code into optimized output
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with HTML, add interactivity strategically  
3. **Developer Experience** - Hot reloading, error handling, and tooling integration
4. **Performance by Default** - Ship minimal JavaScript, load resources on demand
