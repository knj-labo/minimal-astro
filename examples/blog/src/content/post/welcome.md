# Welcome to Minimal Astro

Welcome to our minimal implementation of Astro! This project demonstrates how to build core Astro features from scratch, including:

## Key Features

- **Islands Architecture**: Components are rendered server-side by default, with selective client-side hydration
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Mix React, Vue, and Svelte components in the same project
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management with Zod schemas
- **Fast Development**: Powered by Vite for instant HMR

## Why Build Minimal Astro?

Understanding how modern web frameworks work under the hood is crucial for becoming a better developer. By building a minimal version of Astro, you'll learn:

1. How to parse and transform `.astro` files
2. How server-side rendering works across different frameworks
3. How to implement selective hydration (Islands Architecture)
4. How to create a plugin system for build tools like Vite

## Getting Started

This blog itself is built with minimal-astro! Check out the source code to see how everything works together.

```astro
---
// Example component with Islands Architecture
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
---

<div>
  <h1>Hello from Astro!</h1>
  <Counter client:load />
</div>
```

Stay tuned for more posts explaining each feature in detail!
